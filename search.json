    "text": "The goal of this project is to analyze global population dynamics using data from the World Bank and UN, we examine how birth rates, death rates, migration flows, income groups, and regional characteristics to predict population growth across countries.\nTo measure yearly population growth, we compute the instantaneous growth rate, defined as:\n\\[\nr_t = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere (N_t) represents the population in year (t).\nWe then model this growth rate as a function of variables:\n\\[\nr_t = \\beta_0 +\n      \\beta_1 B_t +\n      \\beta_2 D_t +\n      \\beta_3 M_t +\n      \\beta_4 IG_t +\n      \\beta_5 R_t +\n      \\epsilon_t\n\\]\nThis approach allows us to understand birth and death rates, net migration, income level, and region population trends, and to explore differences in demographic patterns across countries and development groups.\n\n\n\nThe model demonstrates a good overall fit for demographic data. The R-squared value of 0.423 indicates that the model explains about 42% of the variation in population growth rates across countries. The Residual Standard Error (RSE = 0.0138) are small that indicates that the model’s predictions are reasonably accurate and that errors remain well within expected ranges for noisy macro-level population data.\nFinally, the model’s F-statistic (830.5, p &lt; 2e-16) indicates that the set of predictors—birth rate, death rate, migration, income group, and region—collectively provide significant explanatory power. Together, these metrics indicate that the model performs well for global demographic analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residual prediction plots for the baseline model show nonlinear clusters and diagonal patterns in several regions (e.g., North America and Europe & Central Asia). This indicates that trends are not fully captured. While the model reflects the overall direction of growth, the relationship between the predictors and actual outcomes varies considerably across regions, leaving substantial unexplained variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the basic model, the distribution of residuals across regions is centered close to zero. However, several regions such as East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa show wider residual spreads and more extreme outliers. This indicates that the linear specification may not fully capture underlying regional dynamics.\n\n\n\nTo allow the effect of demographic variables to vary across economic and geographical groups, we estimate an extended model that includes interaction terms between birth rates, death rates, migration rates, and the categorical variables Income Group and Region:\n\\[\nr_t =\n\\beta_0 +\n\\beta_1 B_t +\n\\beta_2 D_t +\n\\beta_3 M_t +\n\\beta_4 IG_t +\n\\beta_5 R_t +\n\\beta_6 (B_t \\times IG_t) +\n\\beta_7 (D_t \\times IG_t) +\n\\beta_8 (M_t \\times IG_t) +\n\\beta_9 (B_t \\times R_t) +\n\\beta_{10} (D_t \\times R_t) +\n\\beta_{11} (M_t \\times R_t) +\n\\epsilon_t\n\\]\nThis extended specification allows the slopes of the demographic variables to differ by income level and region.\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nRSE\nR2\nAdjR2\nFstat\nP\nDF\n\n\n\n\nBasic\n0.0138\n0.4231\n0.4226\n830.5\n12\n13589\n\n\nExt\n0.0132\n0.4674\n0.4659\n305.2\n39\n13562\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the basic model, the extended model improves fit (R² increases from 0.423 to 0.467) and reduces prediction error slightly - from 0.01377 to 0.01325.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot summarizes the results of best-subset model selection using three criteria: Cp, BIC, and Adjusted R².

Because the model was built using many interaction terms and subset selection based on the full dataset, there is a real risk of overfitting—performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen years or countries.

However, a few regions still show more outliers, likely reflecting country-specific shocks or other local drivers that are not captured even by this dataset. The overall error patterns highlight that regions such as the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa have wider residual distributions and occasional large deviations. This reflects more volatile or uneven population growth that a linear model struggles to capture. In contrast, regions like Europe and North America display much smaller residual dispersions, indicating more stable and predictable demographic trends that the reduced model can represent more consistently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals are approximately centered around zero and display no structural pattern, suggesting the model form is good.\n\n\n\nIn this part of the project, we extend our analysis from explaining population growth to forecasting future population sizes. We select a base year and use our regression model to predict each country’s future growth rate over a chosen forecast horizon.\nForecast horizon: the interval between the base year and target year: \\[\nh = t_f - t_b\n\\] Regression equations with time-shift by ℎ: \\[\n\\hat r_{t+h}\n= \\beta_0\n+ \\beta_1 B_{t_b}\n+ \\beta_2 D_{t_b}\n+ \\beta_3 M_{t_b}\n+ \\beta_4 IG_{t_b}\n+ \\beta_5 R\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{t+h} = N_{t_b} \\cdot e^{\\hat r_{t+h}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows historical population trends for each global region from 1960 to 2022, followed by a 10-year forecast based on regression-based growth model.\nSub-Saharan Africa shows one of the strongest projected increases. Middle East & North Africa displays the sharpest projected rise. This results from the model assigning relatively high growth rates to this region due to a combination of above-average birth rates, positive region effects, and large positive migration interactions. As a result, forecasted population increases much faster than Europe or North America."
